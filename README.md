# module-2-challenge-dec-5
In this module I started out by picturing how I would want my Portfolio to look. I knew that this would be something that I could always add to and change in the future so I wanted to start with some of the basics.

first I started by making a header tag in HTML and adding my nav that would include all of my navagation links to browse my protfolio.
Now that I added my links it was time to go to my CSS and add all my elements to style my Nav bar.

After I created the nav and was satisfied I created a "Main" tag that would include all of my clickable navigation.

First I wanted to start with the "Home" ID and give the home page a banner that would freshen up the viewer experience.
Next I added my CSS and made sure the home section was displayed correctly.

Second I worked on my "About me" ID and add some filler "lorem Ipsum" just for now and will change this in the future when I am more confident in the job field.
Now it was back to CSS to make all of my CSS changes and make sure all my formating was correct.

Next was the fun part, I want to create my "Work" section to just convey so of the stuff I currently do for fun as well as my current ocupation. I added containers to all the images so I could put labels on each image.
When I added these images I wanted to make them so when you hover over the images the user can tell that they are hovering over them. The CSS to this section was a little more tricky but still fun to work with.

Last was my "Contact" section which I want to add a vertical line to encase my contacts. I also added links that will take you to github or my email address.

Last was my footer and probably the easiest part to add at the end of my webpage.

The CSS in this module was a little more tricky and I ended up looking up a lot of different examples through W3schools, MDN, and YouTube to see tutorials. 

I also added at the end of my CSS stylesheet a Media Querey to make it viewable on different devices.
